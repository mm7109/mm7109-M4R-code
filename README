The code found in this repository is the full version of code in the appendices of my M4R project (masters thesis); Applications of Grobner Basis Methods to Graph Colouring Problems, undertaken at Imperial College London during the period November 2012 to June 2013. 
Unlike the samples in the appendices, it's not neat and contains all of my comments as well as one or two superfluous functions.

The code was written in the SAGE notebook http://www.sagemath.org/

If you need to contact me about this code; mm7109@ic.ac.uk

Feel free to use and improve!
